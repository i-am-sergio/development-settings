## Bugs Report

1. **Gateway not working, not redirecting requests to other microservices.**
   - ***Description:*** The `spring-cloud-starter-gateway-mvc` dependency was used, which has issues with this functionality.
   - ***Solution:*** Modify the dependency in the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`, changing it to `spring-cloud-starter-gateway`.

2. **Common problem with slow response times in the authentication service.**
   - ***Description:*** The authentication service is experiencing slow response times when processing login requests, possibly due to inefficient database queries.
   - ***Solution:*** Optimize database queries by adding proper indexing and reviewing query performance. Alternatively, consider using a caching layer to store frequently accessed data.

3. **Microservice communication failure due to incorrect service discovery configuration.**
   - ***Description:*** Some microservices are not being discovered properly because of a misconfiguration in the Eureka server settings.
   - ***Solution:*** Check the Eureka configuration in each microservice's `application.yml` or `application.properties` and ensure the correct `eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone` is set for the discovery server.

4. **Memory leak in payment processing microservice.**
   - ***Description:*** The payment microservice is experiencing a memory leak, leading to high memory consumption and occasional crashes.
   - ***Solution:*** Investigate object lifecycle management, especially around database connections and other resources. Use a memory profiler to identify the source of the leak and refactor the code accordingly.
